# LCIA Module
This is a work space for Life Cycle Impact Aassessment (LCIA) Module for working group for BONSAI hackathon 2019.

# Defining goals and objectives
The goal of this working group is to collect and prepare LCIA methods (charactherization factors) to convert in RDF format for entry into the database. Information of the methods its provided (e.g. version, when they were obtained, etc...) and how they were used.  
This repository also provides a technical interchange format for data when providing regionalized (i.e. site-dependent).

# Current status
Until now, only LC-IMPACT method was included. 
The correspondence between LC-IMPACT and US EPA Elementary Flow List was only made for the "Climate Change" Impact Category (Note: there are a significant number of elementary flows without correspondence).  
For now, CFs are stoarge in csv format.

# Next Steps
Include other impact categories of LC-Imapct method (including correspondece tables).  
Convert csv format in to RDF format (particular important for regionalized CFs).  
  
In order to keep track of what methods/indicators are available, all developments shall be reported in the [Overview File](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/LCIA_Module/blob/master/raw/_Overview_of_available_correspondence_files.csv)
