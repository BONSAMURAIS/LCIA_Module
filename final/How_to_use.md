# LC-Impact method
## Climate change
##### Radiative Forcing calculation
- Multiply emission value by the "Radiative Forcing" column
  - Emission unit: kilogram
  - Radiative Forcing unit: W m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>
  
##### Temperature increase (100 years horizon)
- Multiply emission value by the " Temperature increase" column
  - Temperature increase unit: ÂºC
